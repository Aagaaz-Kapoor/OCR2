INTERPRETATION 5
A Complete blood picture (CBP) is a screening test which can aid in the diagnosis of a variety of conditions and diseases such as 3
anemia, leukemia, bleeding disorders and infections. is
This test is also useful in monitoring a person's reaction to treatment when a condition which affects blood cells has been diagnosed. &
All the abnormal results are to be correlated clinically. 8
=
DISCLAIMER =
Test results released pertain to the specimen submitted. All test results are dependent on the quality of the sample received by the 3
laboratory. Test Result may show interlaboratory variations. Laboratory investigations are only a tool to facilitate in arriving at a
diagnosis and should be clinically correlated by the referring physician. 5 }
